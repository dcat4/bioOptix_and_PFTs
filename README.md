This repository includes code and data I've written/curated with applications in phytoplankton functional type (PFT) determinations from High Performance Liquid Chromatography phytoplankton pigment determinations, bio-optical modeling of PFT indices, and manipulating bio-optics and remote sensing reflectance data directly.
